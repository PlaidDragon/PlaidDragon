### Welcome to my Portfolio!!👋

I am a data scientist who loves what I do; Data has never been anything but fun for me to dig around in, and you can see in many of my personal projects that I enjoy diving deep and finding the stories it can tell.


This is my porfolio where I put my projects that I am proud of, or that I found interesting.
I include new projects when I find interesting datasets to play around in.


Each repository is dedicated to a specific genre for organization purposes. In each repository you will find a readme that explains all the files that are contained within the given repository

For example, all of my scripts focused on predictive models can be found here:
